``Price Checker Script`` is a pricing consultancy script that checks several marketplaces searching for the desired item with the specified price.

**Current supported marketplaces:**  
- _terabyte_  
- _kabum_  
- _combatinfo_  
- _pichau_  

### OBS:
 After running the script, your antivirus software may detect it as malicious, since the bot is meant to visit different URL's (or even opening your google chrome on the background since some websites needs SELENIUM to extract all the info). So it's highly
 recommended to turn it off before downloading.
 
 You can compile the script bot with the following line:  
 **pyinstaller --hidden-import plyer.platforms.win.notification --onefile marketplace_notifications.py**
